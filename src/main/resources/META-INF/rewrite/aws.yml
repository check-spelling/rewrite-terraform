name: org.openrewrite.terraform.aws.EncryptEBSVolumes
displayName: Encrypt EBS volumes
description: Encrypting EBS volumes ensures that replicated copies of your images are secure even if they are accidentally exposed. AWS EBS encryption uses AWS KMS customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots. Storing EBS volumes in their encrypted state reduces the risk of data exposure or data loss.
